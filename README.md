### Display of a Szilassi polyhedron on X

This is a copy of [Tom Ace's code to display a Szilassi polyhedron on X](https://www.minortriad.com/szilassi.html).  All I've done is to fix some compiler complaints;  for example,  'modern' gcc will complain about use of `char *` for string literals.

Documentation is in [Tom's README file](README).  I may commit other changes at some point.  Thus far,  the aforementioned compiler soothing is the only change I've made.
